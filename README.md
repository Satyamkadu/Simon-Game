# Simon-Game
This is my first project using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT together.
The Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game designed to challenge and improve players' memory and pattern recognition skills. In this web-based project, I've recreated the iconic Simon Game using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
